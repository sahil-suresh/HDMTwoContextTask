## Overview

The Dot Cloud Task presents participants with a series of trials where they must determine the predominant color in a dot cloud and then make a decision based on that color. The task aims to investigate how participants adapt to changing contexts and mappings between stimuli and responses.

## Features

- **Customizable Experiment Parameters:** Set parameters like difficulty levels, inter-stimulus intervals (ISI), inter-trial intervals (ITI), and more via a user-friendly GUI.
- **Tutorial Instructions:** Option to include a tutorial phase to familiarize participants with the task.
- **Randomized Trial Difficulties and Contexts:** Trials vary in difficulty and context to prevent predictability.
- **Data Logging:** Participant responses, reaction times, and accuracy are recorded and saved in a CSV file.
- **Compatibility with Behavioral and fMRI Methods:** Adjustable settings to accommodate different experimental setups.
